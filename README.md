40 seconds chocolate cake
============================

Is Adria is to cooking what Stallman is to open source? 

He invented this method and people keep perfecting it.
This variation is from "Playing with Fire and Water":

I have made some modifications of my own. I scaled her recipe to half, and it works for me.


- 4 egg  (200g)
- 1 additional yolk (17g) 
- 21 g of either: Wondra (US)/Easy blend flour (Canada) (Modernist Cousine trick, but you can use regular flour)
- 80 g sugar
- 1.5 g salt
- 105 g semisweet chocolate
- 2 cartridges of NO2
- 1 siphon (0.5L)
- paper cups

Instructions
------------

- Whisk eggs, sugar and salt (for best results, use electric blender/whisker). You want them fluffy and incorporated
- Melt chocolate (I use the microwave, just do it slowly so you don't burn it)
- Mix into the mixture the flour
- Add the chocolate to the mixture and incorporate
- Pour into the siphon (important: sieve the mixture so it does not clog the siphon)
- Charge the siphon with one cartridge 
- Shake vigorously
- Charge the siphon again, shake again
- put in in the fridge to cool for a couple of hours.

In the original recipe, she does not put it in the fridge. In my experience, the cooling helps.
I got great results one day later.

Now the tricky thing: calibrating the microwave.

My microwave is 800W. I use 40 seconds, and leave the cups upside down for another 30.

So you might have to experiment to get the best results.

- With a knife cuts some slits/holes in the side of the cup close to the bottom
- Optional: spray oil in the inside (helps the release)
- Load the cup to 1/2 way with mixture
- Microwave
- Remove immediately and keep upside down for few seconds (I use 30)
- Remove from cup, serve and eat.

You have to eat it quickly. Otherwise it dries very fast.
